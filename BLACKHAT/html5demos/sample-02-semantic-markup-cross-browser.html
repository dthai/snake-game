        <p>All reports are to be displayed for a certain period. Means, the observation period must be set freely. Basically, with “the period” we mean the time when we got applications into the process for the very first time. However, it should also be a possibility, to select all applications with a decision (E), red or green, in a defined period.
The unit of time is generally days, hours, minutes and seconds.
The values are generally represented in absolute and relative terms.
